<h3>ICTs FOR CITIZENS AND PEACE JOURNALISM </h3>
<div id="for-fonts">
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="justify"> Introduction
  The profession of journalism has traditionally ofte
  n been described as playing an
  important role for maintaining a strong civil socie
  ty and therefore contributing to
  democracy and peace. Today, modern Information and
  Communication Technologies
  (ICTs) such as the Internet, cell phones and other
  “new media” have decisively
  contributed to the globalization process and had nu
  merous impacts on social and
  political structures and the ways in which we inter
  act with each other world-wide
  
  These technologies have greatly transformed the way
  in which information is being
  generated, processed, transmitted, interlinked and
  received. As a medium, they are
  cheaper, faster and more interactive than more trad
  itional media such as radio or
  television. It is therefore obvious that the introd
  uction and widespread availability of
  modern ICTs have also in multiple ways affected the
  field of journalism, a field in which
  the creation, handling and publishing of informatio
  n lie at the very core of activities. </p>
<p align="justify">Two ideas have within the last few years led to new
  types of journalism – the idea that
  everybody can participate not only in the consumpti
  on but also in the production of
  information, and the idea that journalism should be
  shaped by and used for promoting
  the ideal of peace. It appears to be an interesting
  and promising endeavor to more
  closely examine the various roles which the use of
  modern ICTs can play in these fields.
  This paper will touch on a few of these roles, incl
  uding how ICTs can help journalists to
  gather as well as disseminate information, and how
  ICTs can be used for new types of
  journalism such as citizen and peace journalism. </p>
<div align="justify">
<ol>
  <li>
    <h4>ICT FOR JOURNALISM </h4>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>In journalism – and perhaps especially in war journ
    alism and peace journalism –
    information and communication technologies have alw
    ays played a critical role. Even
    before the mainstream availability of the Internet
    and other new media, advances in
    technology have had a direct impact on the professi
    onal collecting and reporting of
    information. For example, when comparing the 1990/1
    991 Gulf War with the 2003 Iraq
    War, it can be observed that the availability of mo
    dern live and portable technology in
    the second war has led to a higher number of active
    journalists in the affected region, as 3
    well as to more and better pictures and to a genera
    lly higher output. Roughly speaking,
    modern ICTs can affect the work of professional jou
    rnalists in two ways: They enable
    them to collect more information, and they make it
    possible to disseminate their own
    work through new publishing channels. </li>
  <br>
  <li><strong><em>Publishing Information </em></strong></li>
  <br>
  <li> In addition to providing new opportunities for coll
    ecting information, ICTs also offer
    journalists new ways of publishing articles, videos
    and other content to their audiences.
    During the early days of the Internet, dystopian pr
    ophecies predicted that new media
    would eventually completely replace newspapers. Whi
    le this has obviously not come
    true, the Internet has definitely become an establi
    shed distribution channel for media
    corporations. Usually the content provided online i
    s similar or equivalent to what is also
    published in traditional media, e.g. a newspaper ma
    y publish the same article in their
    printed and online versions. Often, media corporati
    ons do not only publish content via a
    website, but also on social networking services. Fo
    r example, German newspaper “Der
    Spiegel” has both an active Facebook community  and several Twitter accounts. In some
    cases, news broadcasts shown on television can also
    be watched online
    6
    . In other cases,
    a broadcaster may publish certain content exclusively online. </li>
  <br>
  <li>Pure online newspapers and magazines exist as well,
    which in many cases are not any
    less professional than their traditional counterpar
    ts. One of the best known and most
    respected examples of a pure online newspaper is Th
    e Huffington Post. founded in
    2005. Besides large media corporations, independent
    journalists also use ICTs for
    publishing their work online.</li>
  <br>
  <li>
    <h4>Citizen
      Journalism </h4>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>When considering this phenomenon of a high number o
    f potential publishers with a very
    diverse background and level of education, then som
    e of the questions that have to be
    asked are whether the individuals who are publishin
    g information abide by basic
    journalistic principles, and whether an actual audi
    ence exists for their activity. In a
    public sphere that is inherently unstructured and l
    ittle regulated, competition arises,
    and complex social processes decide how the interes
    ting “signals” get separated from
    the insignificant “noise”. While the casual “blogos
    phere”, “twittersphere” or the
    otherwise general public sphere online is not alway
    s likely to produce articles or other
    content of widespread interest, great relevance, an
    d deep impact, there is however also
    a segment of more dedicated individuals who activel
    y endeavor to publish content
    which actually constitutes valuable content for pol
    itical or cultural processes. This can
    range from weblogs dedicated to someone’s professio
    nal expertise, to alternative media
    platforms with more or less regular contributors. <br>
    <br>
    Examples of such media platforms and other successf
    ul citizen journalism initiatives
    include: </li>
  <br>
  <ol>
    <li type="1"> Groundviews is Sri Lanka’s first citizen journalism website fo
      unded in 2006.
      According to an interview
      with founder Sanjana Hattotuwa, it focuses on
      narratives and issues that mainstream media do not
      report, which is critical to Sri
      Lanka’s post-war democratic future. </li>
    <br>
    <li type="1">The blogging platform “Global Voices”
      runs a so-called bridge-blogging service
      where volunteer authors, translators and editors at
      tempt to provide reports from
      a local perspective that cannot normally be found i
      n the mainstream media,
      therefore raising awareness and cross-cultural unde
      rstanding. </li>
    <br>
    <li type="1">The Independent Media Center
      (also called IndyMedia) is a network of online
      platforms where anyone can contribute by writing ar
      ticles. It covers political and
      social issues and was created as an alternative to
      large government and
      corporate media. </li>
    <br>
    <li type="1">iReport
      is an initiative by CNN, which encourages individu
      als to publish reports
      from their own local towns and neighborhoods. This
      example is interesting
      insofar as it is citizen journalism operating withi
      n the infrastructure of a large
      media corporation. </li>
  </ol>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h4>PEACE journalism</h4>
  <br>
  <li>Millions of people have put up personal profiles, with statements, photographs, and more on
    web sites such as MySpace, face book, tagged etc. Like blogs, these profiles can help to
    understand people who are different than us, and show the similarities across cultures and
    geographical boundaries. </li>
  <br>
  <li>The exact technological means for both professional
    journalists and average citizens to
    share information with an online audience are diver
    se and can range from simple.websites and weblogs to social networking services
    or the popular video sharing
    platform Youtube. It is however interesting to note
    that, as a response to the rise of
    citizen journalism, ICT entrepreneurs and engineers
    have reacted by developing
    communication technologies that are specifically de
    signed for empowering individuals
    to collect and disseminate news. Many of these tech
    nologies are aimed at guaranteeing
    access to information and communication networks in
    environments where such access
    might sometimes be restricted. For example, during
    the 2011 Arab Spring, the reason
    why the Egyptian government succeeded in shutting d
    own the country’s Internet
    connectivity was that almost all of its connections
    were controlled by only four major
    companies, which implemented the shutdown in a conc
    erted action within only 15
    minutes. Also, social networking services such as Facebook
    or Twitter are highly
    centralized, making it easy to monitor and manipula
    te all communication that takes
    place on such services. </li>
  <br>
  <li>The following is a list of some hard
    - and software technology projects
    that can have a direct impact on the effectiveness
    of journalism and activism: </li>
  <br>
  <ol>
    <li type="circle">One of the most popular projects is Tor , which has been used extensively during
      both the Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions
      . It allows users to transmit
      messages and access websites in an anonymous way, b
      y sharing and disguising
      their communication with other participants in a di
      stributed network. </li>
    <br>
    <li type="circle">Psiphon
      is a so-called proxy server software, which enable
      s users to access
      censored websites by establishing connections throu
      gh an intermediate, non-
      censored system. The project views the Internet as
      a “global commons” that
      should not be </li>
    <br>
    <li type="circle">FreedomBox
      is a software project initiated by Columbia Univer
      sity law
      professor Eben Moglen, who has frequently criticize
      d the Internet’s ability to
      monitor people’s behavior. The project’s stated pur
      pose is to “facilitate free
      communication among people, safely and securely, be
      yond the ambition of the
      strongest power to penetrate”, and the project’s we
      bsite explicitly describes itself
      as a “platform that resists oppression and censorsh
      ip”, and “an organizing tool for
      democratic activities in hostile regimes”. </li>
    <br>
    <li type="circle">Tonika
      promises social networks based on principles that
      human societies
      implement organically in daily life, with robust se
      curity, anonymity, resilience
      and performance. </li>
    <br>
    <li type="circle">Similarly, Diaspora
      is also a decentralized social networking software
      that tries
      to provide Facebook-like functionality without bein
      g dependent on a single entity
      which controls all participants. </li>
    <br>
    <li type="circle">The serval project
      (“uniting the world through communication”) goes a
      s far as
      stating that communication should be a human right.
      It focuses on mobile phones
      and tries to develop software that makes them work
      under any circumstances
      and without infrastructure. </li>
    <br>
    <li type="circle">The Commotion wireless project
      
      specifically references the protests in Tunisia,
      Egypt and Libya, and argues that “democratic activi
      sts around the globe need a
      secure and reliable platform to ensure their commun
      ications cannot be
      controlled or cut off by authoritarian regimes”. </li>
