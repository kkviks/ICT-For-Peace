            <h3>PILLARS OF PEACE </h3>
            <div id="for-fonts">
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="justify">To date, the overwhelming emphasis within peace and 
                conflict studies has been placed on understanding the 
                causes of war or violence. In contrast, the Pillars of Peace 
                is an attempt to systematically expand and explore our 
                understanding of the factors that drive peace.</p>
              <p align="justify">It  links peace 
                with key economic, governance and cultural attitudes as 
                well as with a number of formal and informal institutions. 
                These same factors are also associated with many other 
                aspects that are considered highly desirable such as a 
                strong business environment, gender equality, high levels 
                of human capital, economic development and social 
                cohesion. </p>
              <p align="justify">These factors are intuitively understood and visualised 
                through an eight-part taxonomy:</p>
              <div align="justify">
                <ol>
                  <li type="1"><em><strong>Smooth-Functioning Government.</strong></em><br>
                    <br>
                    Based on several factors, 
                    from how governments are elected and the political culture 
                    they engender, to the quality of the public services they 
                    deliver and their political stability. Strong relationships 
                    across a number of these indicators and sub-indicators 
                    demonstrate the interdependent nature of the various 
                    governance indicators. These measures are consistently 
                    linked to peace. </li>
                  <br>
                  <li type="1"><em><strong>Sound and Conducive Business Environment.</strong></em><br>
                    <br>
                    The strength of economic 
                    conditions as well as the formal institutions that 
                    support the operation of the private sector determine 
                    the soundness of the business environment. Business 
                    competitiveness and economic freedom are both 
                    associated with the most peaceful countries, as is the 
                    presence of regulatory systems which are conducive to 
                    business operation. </li>
                  <br>
                  <li type="1"><em><strong>Equitable Distribution of Resources.</strong></em><br>
                    <br>
                    Refers to income 
                    distribution but more importantly to whether there is equity 
                    and access to resources such as education and health.</li>
                  <br>
                  <li type="1"><em><strong>Acceptance of the Rights of Others.</strong></em><br>
                    <br>
                    A category designed 
                    to include both the formal laws that guarantee basic 
                    human rights and freedoms as well as the informal social 
                    and cultural norms that relate to behaviors of citizens. 
                    These factors can be seen as proxies for tolerance between 
                    different ethnic, linguistic, religious, and socio-economic 
                    groups within a country. A commitment to human rights 
                    and freedom are key characteristics of peaceful countries, 
                    a claim supported by very strong correlations with several 
                    indexes measuring human rights. Also important are societal 
                    attitudes towards fellow citizens, minorities, ethnic groups, 
                    genders and foreigners.</li>
                  <br>
                  <li type="1"><em><strong>Good Relations with Neighbours.</strong></em><br>
                    <br>
                    Refers to the relations 
                    between individuals and communities as well as to cross-border relations. Countries with positive external relations 
                    are more peaceful and tend to be more politically stable, 
                    have better functioning governments, are regionally 
                    integrated and have low levels of organised internal conflict.</li>
                  <br>
                  <li type="1"><em><strong>Free-Flow of Information</strong></em><br>
                    <br>
                    Captures the extent to which 
                    citizens can gain access to information, whether the media 
                    is free and independent, as well as how well-informed 
                    citizens are and the extent of their engagement in the 
                    political process. Peaceful countries tend to have free and 
                    independent media which disseminates information in a way 
                    that leads to greater openness and helps individuals and 
                    civil society work together. This leads to better decision-making and rational responses in times of crisis.</li>
                  <br>
                  <li type="1"><em><strong>High Levels of Human Capital </strong></em><br>
                    <br>
                    A broad human capital base 
                    increases the pool of human capital which in turn improves 
                    economic productivity, enables political participation, 
                    and increases social capital. Education in many ways is a 
                    fundamental building block through which societies can 
                    build resilience and develop mechanisms to learn and adapt. 
                    Mean years of schooling is closely associated with the most 
                    peaceful countries, however tertiary levels of education 
                    conclusion51
                    pillars of peace
                    and the percentage of government spending dedicated to 
                    education is not statistically as important. </li>
                  <br>
                  <li type="1"><em><strong>Low Levels of Corruption </strong></em><br>
                    <br>
                    In societies with high corruption 
                    resources are inefficiently allocated, often leading to a lack 
                    of funding for essential services. The resulting inequality 
                    can lead to civil unrest and in extreme situations can be the 
                    catalyst for more violence. Low corruption, by contrast, can 
                    enhance confidence and trust in institutions, which in turn 
                    helps to create informal institutions that enhance peace. </li>
                  <br>
                  <p><br>
                  </p>
                </ol>
                <p align="justify">These structures, attitudes and institutions can also 
                  help promote resilience in society, enabling nations to 
                  overcome adversity and resolve internal economic, cultural, 
                  and political conflict through peaceful methods. They can 
                  be seen as interconnected and interacting in varied and 
                  complex ways, forming either virtuous circles of peace 
                  creation or vicious circles of destruction, with causality 
                  running in either direction depending on individual 
                  circumstances. Overall the complex and multidimensional 
                  nature of peace can be observed, underlining the need for 
                  pluralist and multidisciplinary approaches to understand the 
                  interrelationships between economic, political, and cultural 
                  factors that affect peace.</p>
