            <div id="for-fonts">
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="justify">Mobile phones are the most ubiquitous communications technology in
                the world. Besides transforming the way in which we communicate,
                they can also be used as a powerful tool for conflict prevention and
                management.</p>
              <p align="justify">Mobile services
                have a proven track record in markets like Kenya, Pakistan and beyond of
                contributing to economic and social development.</p>
              <div align="justify">
                <ol>
                  <li>Clearly, mobile services will only be one
                    of several tools when working to overcome political, economic and security problems facing post-conflicts countries. Below we outline some of the key post-conflicts challenges and subsequently
                    explore how mobile services may cont
                    ribute towards overcoming these
                    .</li>
                  <br>
                  <li><em><strong> Political
                    challenges
                    and
                    mobile services </strong></em> <br>
                    <br>
                    Politically,
                    a post
                    -
                    conflict
                    setting is one where
                    there is a need to reconcile warring parties and
                    address deeper
                    grievances held by
                    the different warring sides. One way to facilitate this is to
                    design n
                    ew inclusive political arrangements where the voice
                    s
                    of all social groups are heard. This might entail
                    amending
                    the constitution and holding free and fair elections. A
                    t a deeper level there will be a need to re-organise political activity away from miltia groups and towards broader political grouping that are more civilian in nature and involve broad segments of the population.Further, goverment institutions are often weak or non-existing and efforts are made to bolster these. These inclucde reforming army, police and judicial structures. It also entails (re-)activating ministries and regional branches of the government administration so as to ensure a government presence not only in large cities but also in rural areas.</li>
                  <br>
                  <li> The state of Kerala in India is pioneering mobile governance and Kerala’s endeavours may
                    serve as an inspiration to post-conflict countries.  Despite high poverty rates, around 80
                    percent of the population has access to mobile phones and the state is piloting a mechanism
                    for citizens to access government information. Citizens can address the government through
                    voice SMS and data applications. All intra-departmental and inter-departmental notifications
                    happen through an SMS gateway (eSMS). There are also attempts to establish a mobile
                    crime and accident-reporting platform for the police force so as to bolster police efficiency. </li>
                  <br>
                  <li> Similarly, elections are one step in the transition from war to peace. The electoral process
                    has in many cases proven to be difficult with widespread accusations of fraud and rigging.
                    This undermines the democratisation process and the legitimacy of the new political
                    leadership. Election observation is increasingly making use of mobile platforms that invite
                    citizen monitoring of voting stations in efforts to make elections free and fair. This may be of
                    relevance in post-conflict settings too. By way of example, the Citizens Election Watch-IT
                    (CEWIT) in Uganda received over 40 000 SMS from concerned citizens and these were
                    digested and visualised onto digital maps. This made it possible to expose, in real time,
                    polling stations where irregularities where happening.</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <li><em><strong> Economic challenges and mobile services </strong></em></li>
                <ol>
                  <br>
                  <li> In economic terms, post-war recovery settings tend to have high rates of poverty and
                    unemployment and the informal and illicit parts of the economy often dominate. Post-war
                    economies also struggle with high outward migration of skilled labour and low rates of foreign
                    direct investment. The government’s tax base is weak due to the large informal economy
                    (which by definition fails to generate government income) and low GDP. A reduced tax base
                    makes it difficult to build a well functioning state. Poverty and unemployment also make
                    continued engagement in militia movements more tempting as these networks may offer
                    salaries or at the very least provide for the upkeep of the soldier.</li>
                  <br>
                  <li> There are immediate benefits associated with mobile services that support economic
                    development in a range of countries, including those recovering from conflict. Goldman
                    Sachs, among many, emphasise the importance of mobile penetration for growth. They
                    highlight the World Bank finding that for every 10 percent increase in mobile phone
                    penetration, per capita GDP grows by 0.7 percent.  The Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)
                    associated with new mobile operations also contributes to recovery. Mobile operators trigger
                    investments, for example through procuring and installing mobile masts and expanding
                    business operations. This generates state revenue and provides private sector employment
                    in the formal economy.</li>
                  <br>
                  <li> Auctions of mobile licences may also be an important revenue for the state. This kind of
                    revenue is particularly useful for states in the immediate post-war years. In this period, there
                    is often an influx of external financial and material assistance from donors, but these funds
                    are often controlled more by the donors and less by the countries in question. Income from
                    auctions can be “free cash flow” at the disposal of the government. Such processes can also,
                    however, be marred by a lack of transparency, weak governance and corruption.</li>
                  <br>
                  <p align="justify">Perhaps the most important economic contribution associated with mobile phones is the
                    growth of mobile financial services, often labelled mobile banking. This is the provision of
                    ‘branchless banking’ through mobile handsets where users can make fast, easy and cost
                    effective payments and transfers.  Mobile banking creates essential financial infrastructure
                    for small-scale entrepreneurs and increases access to capital. It also brings more people into
                    the formal economy and can increase saving within the banking system. These are benefits
                    that are particularly important in post-war settings, where the informal economy tends to be
                    especially large and hinders tax uptake. Moreover, the security situation makes it risky to
                    transfer cash across the country. Mobile transfers offer one solution to this problem.</p>
                  <p align="justify">Kenya is one of the markets where the mobile banking solutions were pioneered and is today
                    one of the important hubs for innovation in mobile services. 15 An important factor in
                    explaining the rapid uptake and popularity of the mobile banking solutions is the need by
                    workers in the cities to channel remittances to rural home communities. The M-PESA service
                    offers an easy, safe and cheap solution for sending these remittances. Post-war societies
                    often have high rates of displaced people, migrants and uprooted communities. Transfer of
                    funds through mobile banking may therefore be particularly helpful for these groups.</p>
                  <p align="justify">Finally, aside from facilitating economic transactions, mobile services may also improve the
                    availability of market information to small-scale entrepreneurs and farmers. This addresses
                    an important feature of the post-conflict economy; power imbalances among economic
                    agents. Typically, entrepreneurs that are aligned with, or part of, old militia groups and
                    political factions control some of the key posts in the economy. Large retailers or
                    importers/exporters often have strong political connections and play the role of middlemen
                    who influence price and availability of goods and capital. Individual entrepreneurs and
                    farmers are vulnerable in this situation because they are smaller and unconnected. This
                    skewed power balance may result in unfavourable market terms for small-scale
                    entrepreneurs. However, mobile updates on market demand and local, regional and
                    international prices may go some way in unlocking these relationships. In India, poor farmers
                    have benefited from the Reuters service Reuters Market Light, which offers crop and weather
                    forecasts in combination with price information.In Afghanistan, the mobile operator Roshan
                    is experimenting with a service termed Malomat, which gives Afghan farmers access to price
                    information for over 30 commodities. </p>
                  <br>
                  <li type="circle"><em> <strong>Security challenges and mobile services</strong></em></li>
                  <br>
                  <p align="justify">We see that in many post-conflict settings, even where there has been a formal end to the
                    war and a formal peace settlement, militia groups continue to have access to arms.
                    Moreover, as political violence ends, violence associated with crime rises. Many citizens feel
                    as insecure as they did in the war years. This has two sides. Citizens may feel insecure due
                    to an absence of police and army presence in their areas. Or the reverse, citizens may feel
                    insecure due to this presence. This is because former (violent) strongmen during the war
                    years often gain new formal positions in the police, custom agencies and border guards,
                    while there are few control mechanisms for recovering institutions and levels of impunity may
                    be high. This makes individuals vulnerable to abuse and easy targets for public officers
                    seeking bribes.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p align="justify">In this situation, a mobile handset is in itself a security boost, as it allows the holder to call for
                    help if threatened or attacked. There is also a growing number of examples where citizens
                    film incidents of abuse by government personnel and post them on the internet.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p align="justify">In this situation, a mobile handset is in itself a security boost, as it allows the holder to call for

                  <br>
                  <p align="justify"> More elaborate way to use mobile phones to increase security is found in Democratic
                    Republic of Congo (DRC). The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) reports that as
                    part of a pilot initiative three community representatives (a traditional leader, a woman and
                    an elected official) were given a mobile phone with monthly credits. These representatives
                    report security incidents and human rights abuses through a ‘code sheet’. The information is
                    then aggregated and distributed to government and organisations. This inexpensive solution
                    offers bottom-up generated, yet high quality, data on security threats across the country,
                    which can help the government and humanitarian organisations address safety challenges
                    for the population.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p align="justify">There are, however, also more specific challenges that tie in with the distinct predicament of
                    a post-conflict situation. These challenges are related to the security situation, risk aversion
                    among customers, the prevalence of fraud and identification problems, misuse of mobile
                    services by warring parties and power imbalances associated with the post-war political set-
                    up. Below we highlight some of the most important challenges in more detail.</p>
                  <br>
                  <ol>
                    <li type="1"><strong>Security</strong>
                      <p>In a post-conflict setting, law and order is weak in many areas. This makes SIM card vendors
                        and mobile banking agents vulnerable to attack. Further, representatives of the mobile
                        operators will have restrictions on movements due to security threats, leading to
                        maintenance delays. To exacerbate this, examples show that mobile masts can be destroyed
                        by insurgents. This leads to high operational costs for mobile operators in post-conflict
                        settings.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li type="1"><strong>Risk-averse customers</strong>
                      <p>The experiences of war may discourage long-term planning, and in turn, the effort and
                        interest in trying new services. Citizens may have experienced commercial services that
                        have come and gone under different regimes, while a few resilient services, perhaps
                        traditional ones, have endured. So while the potential benefits and suitability of mobile
                        solutions in post-conflict setting may be obvious on paper, a risk averse population may want
                        to avoid the start-up costs and the perceived risks of new commercial offerings.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li type="1"><strong>IDs and fraud</strong>
                      <p>Obtaining formal identity cards and passports is often a bottleneck in situations where the
                        government is not running efficiently. This makes it difficult to identify and register new customers. In turn, counterfeits in registrations and attempts to fraud services such as mobile
                        banking flourish.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li type="1"><strong>Mobile services form part of the conflict</strong>
                      <p>Mobile services providers often find that new solutions are proving as useful for criminal
                        groups and spoilers of the peace as they are to the segments of society that are trying to
                        move forward in the post-war period. By way of example, mobile banking services have
                        reportedly assisted money transfers of Somali pirates, and the Islamic militant group in
                        Somalia, Al-Shabaab, are active Twitter users. Another example is how call or SMS records
                        on individual phones can be used to track movements or prove allegiance to a particular
                        group or party which in turn can be used to control or in threats or extortion.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li type="1"><strong>Power, regulation and hostility to scaling up</strong>
                      <p>Above, we noted that a solid regulatory framework facilitates the launch of mobile services.
                        However, as a society transitions from war to peace, new regulation may be difficult to
                        introduce. Politicians and top government may not have the time or capacity to attend to
                        such regulatory issues among other key tasks such as forging a new constitution or deciding
                        on who should get to form government. Another difficult challenge stems from how the war
                        years have often concentrated power in the hands of a select group of individuals or
                        institutions. These may often wield their power unchecked. New technological services that
                        can help mitigate this may be met with resistance. One example is how the provision of
                        market information to small-scale entrepreneurs helps challenge monopolies, but as a
                        consequence also key vested interests. This may lead to pressure from powerful economic
                        or political interests to stall or delay such services. This makes the launch and uptake of new
                        services in a post-conflict setting particularly difficult.</p>
