            <h3>HIGH LEVEL OF HUMAN CAPITAL </h3>
            <div id="for-fonts">
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="justify">Human capital describes a country's stock of skills, 
                knowledge and behaviours. Whilst the concept of human 
                capital is often narrowly defined as the economic benefits 
                associated with education, this approach considers the 
                definition in its wider context to not only include education 
                but also individuals' health and attitudes which materially 
                impact their contribution to the community.</p>
              <p align="justify"> Overall it 
                is suggested that greater levels of human capital, such as 
                health and education, will tend to increase social cohesion, 
                economic development, and peace.</p>
              <p align="justify">In considering the level of human capital within a nation 
                it is important to recognise that it is not just the levels which 
                matter, but also its utilisation. This is illustrated by a survey 
                by the World Bank which found that individuals who had 
                joined Rebel movements tended to cite unemployment or 
                idleness as a motivating factor.</p>
              <p align="justify">This has also been supported by research which suggests 
                that countries with higher youth unemployment tend to face 
                greater risks of conflict. Specifically, it was found that the 
                majority of recent episodes of mass violence had occurred 
                in nations with high youth populations.</p>
              <p align="justify">Although 
                this is suggested to partially be a consequence of poorer 
                nations having higher fertility rates, it is also possible that 
                this reflects the impact of there being a lack of alternative 
                opportunities for youth. This is supported by the results 
                of surveys of those involved in conflict in Sierra Leone 
                which found that many recruits of rebel groups tended to 
                be young, poor and those who were forced to end their 
                schooling early.When examined against the level of 
                peace, there is a clear association with peace and the level 
                of health-related human capital.</p>
              <p align="justify"> it is also necessary to highlight the importance 
                of utilising human capital, that is, sufficient opportunities 
                need to exist in order for a nation's human capital to be 
                usefully employed. Without these, other factors will come 
                into play that affects the state of peacefulness. This has 
                been reflected in measures such as the ability for 'Children 
                to Learn and Grow', 'Job Satisfaction' and 'Freedom in 
                Your Life' measures, which all provide a proxy for both the 
                perceived ability to grow and learn within a country. </p>
