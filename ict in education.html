              <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="justify">One of the most popular development use of ICTs globally is in education. "Virtual"
                universities and other institutions are springing up to meet the challenge of providing education
                to a growing number of students with limited resources. Less well known are attempts to use
                ICTs to rehabilitate child ex-combatants especially in Africa. In Sierra Leone, more than 200
                young people affected by war have participated in a project run by the non-governmental
                International Education and Research Network. Their multi-media showcase on the Internet
                includes essays, images and music that tells of the human toll of their civil war, however due to
                digital divide, inaccessibility of the Internet in this country has been the biggest challenge facing
                the project. This exercise is painstaking as project organisers must hire bus to get access to the
                Internet in urban areas. Sometimes the students walk and then often have to queue up for hours
                waiting for computers at Internet cafés. The project has touched the hearts of many people
                around the world. The UN office of displaced persons is considering form of ICT facilitated
                education as a potential model for use in four additional parts of the world that have been
                affected by war, Cambodia, Palestine, Sri Lanka and Uganda. (African Recovery, 2005).</p>
              <p align="justify">In South Africa a group of academics recently launched an online Northern Sotho-English
                dictionary -- the first of its kind -- to help develop a language, one of South Africa's 11 official
                ones, that has historically been neglected. In Uganda, an online counseling service exists to train
                teachers and students to counsel young people in HIV prevention and care. But many local ICT
                initiatives such as these are hindered by the lack adequate access to ICT due to digital divide.</p>

                    <h4>

                  <li>Knowledge is power, when people are well informed they are empowered. ICT has made this
                    possible in many countries. Information reach people through cell phones, internet, satellite
                    television and radio stations. Sadly due to problem of digital divide a lot of people are cut off
                    from this remarkable benefits of ICT. For example In Zimbabwe, the Kubatana project, a website
                    linking 230 civil and community-based groups, provides information on new legislation, the
                    electoral system and voter registration procedures, as well as major social issues confronting the
                    country, such as HIV/AIDS. Owners of the website describe their work as "electronic activism."
                    Users say the network is particularly useful given the current clampdown on the media in
                    Zimbabwe. It reaches out to Zimbabweans who do not have computers at home or at work
                    through public Internet facilities emerging across the country. During major rights campaigns,
                    members of the network have asked those with computers to print campaign material and hand it
                    out or post it to those without access.</li>
                  <br>
                  <li>Increased understanding – of different cultures, languages, and concerns – can go a long way
                    toward reducing conflict. Communication technologies, especially the internet, can make distant
                    situations more understandable and other people seem more like us. For example:</li>
                  <br>
                  <li>Literally understanding each other’s language is a first step to deeper understanding. While
                    the tools for automated translation are in its infancy, it will be important to watch how it
                    develops. The United States Department of Defense has invested millions in the development of
                    handheld translation devices to aid soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan. Translation is not an easy
                    challenge: sometimes words appear to translate across language barriers, but secretly hide deep
                    cultural differences of perspective.</li>
                  <br>
                  <li>Reading informal accounts of events or lives through a blog can be a powerful way to
                    understand different cultures and ways of life. The Global Voices online network, for instance,
                    was formed to highlight, support and amplify the voices of those who are often underrepresented
                    by traditional media. The network focuses on supporting bloggers who blog in countries and on
                    topics that rarely get mainstream coverage.</li>
                  <br>
                  <li>
                    <h4>Relationship and Peace Building</h4>
                  </li>
                  <br>
                  <li>Establishing and maintaining contact is one vital way of ensuring that relationship flourishes.
                    ICT has proven that it can facilitate this through its various services on establishing global
                    friendship.ICTs can be a tremendous help to those trying to maintain or form new relationships.
                    The ability to communicate through the written word, photos, sound clips, video clips, and web
                    cameras can keep people connected regardless of how far apart they are geographically.</li>
                  <br>
                  </li>
                  <br>
                  <li>Millions of people have put up personal profiles, with statements, photographs, and more on
                    web sites such as MySpace, face book, tagged etc. Like blogs, these profiles can help to
                    understand people who are different than us, and show the similarities across cultures and
                    geographical boundaries. </li>
                  <br>
                  <li>A "friendship tree" -- a contact list of about 100 Zimbabweans -- is activated by owners of
                    the site every time an activist is arrested to ensure that witnesses are available to monitor the
                    court proceedings. There are several other friendship sites which has fostered on line peaceful
                    coexistence globally However because of the digital divide such opportunities are not available
                    to million of people who lack access to ICT facilities.</li>
                  <br>
                  <li> Many social networks on the internet and in civil society have started to share similarities
                    with distributed networks but they are still limited in certain regards. Social networks have
                    certainly extended their reach geographically to cover a good portion of the developing world but
                    there is still a great deal of untapped poocracy are often associated with each other.
                    However, many question the ethics and procedures of the Wikileaks organization stating that the
                    publication of classified documents results in more harm than good. Certain critiques respect
                    and support the right of Wikileaks to criticize governments but they caution that publishing
                    material without properly vetting the data can lead to egregious consequences, “minimizing harm
                    does not mean not damaging the public profile of government. It means not naming informants,
                    human activists, or innocent third parties if that would prompt reprisals. It means not providing
                    detailed information that would help terrorists attack a public institution.”</li>
                  <br>
                  <li>The main purpose of Wikileaks is to
                    expose interactions between governments and make international relations more transparent.
                    Exposing governments in some cases may make the world a more safer and peaceful place and in
                    others that may make the world less safe and more violent. The creation of Wikileaks and
                    websites like it may eventually force governments to change the way they conduct business with
                    each other and with their citizens. That may be a good thing in many regards and in certain
                    situations but there is likely to be great controversy over whether Wikileaks is the proper method
                    for exacting change.</li>
