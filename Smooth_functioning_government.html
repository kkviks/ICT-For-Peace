            <h3>SMOOTH FUNCTIONING GOVERNMENT </h3>
            <div id="for-fonts">
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="justify">Well-functioning government can be broken down into two major domains. The first refers to the government&rsquo;s effectiveness, its governance activities and the rule of law. The second domain refers to the way in which the government shares the same vision as its citizens, that it is accountable and allows its citizens to have a voice in decision making.</p>
              <p align="justify">Practically this might entail how it manages public resources, responds to external shocks or engages the community in decision making. Importantly, this concept also extends beyond the political sphere to that of civil servants who administer the day to day operation of government. Furthermore, because a well-functioning government relies on the participation of civil society, it can extend beyond the mechanics of government to community relationships.</p>
              <p align="justify">Consequently a well-functioning government when combined with the other Pillars is more likely to create peaceful individuals, that is, community members who profit from strengthening community ties, as opposed to those who profit from conflict. The importance of well-functioning government has also been reinforced by recent research from the World Bank which has suggested that improved governance strengthens development and improves living standards.</p>
              <div align="justify">
                <ul>
                  <li>Because the government controls a large proportion of a country&rsquo;s resources, it has a major impact on the wellbeing of individuals through how well and fairly it is run. This might mean the difference between having access to land, water, social security, education and having rules which are favourable to operating a business. Consequently, a poorly governed country can create the seeds of tension by either the under provision of public goods or their inequitable distribution. Community wellbeing, peace and a well-functioning government are therefore inextricably linked. Additionally, a government which supports individuals, business and communities is also likely to encourage stable community relationships, encouraging optimism and allow people to better plan for their future. <br>
                  </li>
                  <li><br>
                    A consequence of this is that people can be more confident about engaging in long-term projects such as starting a new business, engaging in education or investing in community building. By doing this, individuals and communities will strengthen social networks and safety nets which in turn can help encourage greater resilience.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
              <br>
              <h4>Government Effectiveness and Goverance<br>
                <br>
              </h4>
              <p align="justify">Where public services such as health, education and 
                investment in infrastructure are performed efficiently 
                and effectively, community needs are more likely to be 
                met, thereby encouraging greater wellbeing and a more 
                peaceful community. Furthermore, because government is 
                responsible for the maintenance of the safety and security 
                of its citizens through the provision and maintenance of 
                public services such as police, fire, army and ambulance 
                services, the effectiveness of government has strong 
                implications for the strength of other Pillars, such as low 
                levels of corruption and a sound business environment.</p>
              <br>
              <p align="justify">A range of measures 
                of the effectiveness of government being found to be 
                associated with peace. This result is likely to have occurred for a number 
                of reasons.</p>
              <br>
              <div align="justify">
                <ol>
                  <li type="1"> The more democratic a country is, the better 
                    their provisioning of public services is likely to be. This 
                    appeared to be confirmed in the analysis, with democracies 
                    tending to have better public services when compared with 
                    authoritarian and hybrid regimes.</li>
                  <br>
                  <li type="1"> Those countries which were democratic also 
                    tended to have higher incomes. High incomes have been 
                    found to be associated with a lower risks of internal conflict.  Despite this, it is notable that some low-income 
                    countries are more peaceful than high-income countries 
                    reflecting the fact that a country's level of income is not 
                    the sole determinant of its peacefullness. <br>
                  </li>
                  <p><br>
                  </p>
                </ol>
                <h4>Rule of Law</h4>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p align="justify">The rule of law and separation of powers describes how 
                  power is exercised, disputes are resolved and to what 
                  extent government is separate and compliant with the 
                  legal system. Because the rule of law can help ensure the 
                  protection of the rights of individuals, a country with a 
                  better functioning legal system is expected to be more 
                  likely to resolve grievances in a peaceful and equitable 
                  manner. </p>
                <p align="justify">Because a country with the rule of law will tend to have 
                  accepted, non-violent mechanisms for resolving conflicts, it 
                  underpins peaceful responses to community tensions. This 
                  is because an effective legal system can provide a non-violent avenue for the resolution of conflict. Since the rule of 
                  law requires the support of individuals, it is also important 
                  to recognise its strong links with the acceptance of the 
                  rights of others. That is, the rule of law requires both formal 
                  institutions and a culture which supports them.</p>
                <p align="justify">'Separation of powers' describes how authority is 
                  distributed across government. Nations which have powers 
                  vested in a range of bodies are expected to be less open to 
                  abuse by government. This is chiefly expected to be a 
                  consequence of government leaders having their powers 
                  subject to the review of other parties. This is likely to be 
                  particularly important for minimizing the potential avenues 
                  for corruption as it would provide a greater assurance of 
                  accountability through increased oversight.</p>
                <p align="justify">Nations in which power is more diversely distributed as 
                  described by the separation of powers, are also expected 
                  to have a legal system which is more independent and 
                  equitable. Although the extent of this will depend on the laws themselves, as the legal system becomes more 
                  independent the application of laws will tend to be less 
                  arbitrary and less open to abuse by those in positions 
                  of power. Because the trust individuals have in the legal 
                  system is a key factor underlying their willingness to engage 
                  in formal means of conflict resolution, it is also expected 
                  that the separation of powers can help encourage greater 
                  community engagement, thereby encouraging the peaceful 
                  resolution of conflict. The overall relationship between peace and measures 
                  of the 'rule of law' are likely to reflect a range of factors.</p>
                <p align="justify">Those countries with incomes beyond a certain level will tend to have better resourced legal systems; therefore 
                  one would expect the rule of law and peace to be positively 
                  associated as,</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <ol>
              <li type="1">
                <div align="justify">Because the rule of law provides a 
                  peaceful avenue for the resolution of community tensions, 
                  countries with better legal systems would also tend to 
                  be less prone to conflict and therefore more peaceful.</div>
              </li>
              <div align="justify"><br>
              </div>
              <li type="1">
                <div align="justify">There are also some rights which are thought to 
                  be consistent across nations. These might include the 
                  right to life, to be treated equally regardless of race or 
                  gender, or the right to speak freely or own property. 
                  The relationship between such 'basic rights' and conflict 
                  was also noted by the World Bank in the 2011 World 
                  Development Report. The report found that with each point rise in the Political Terror Scale, there was 
                  a doubling of the chance of conflict occurring. It was 
                  suggested that this might occur both as a consequence 
                  of the grievances created through government abuse of 
                  rights and the limited means for individuals and groups 
                  to air these grievances.</div>
              </li>
              <p><br>
              </p>
              <h4>Voice and Accountability</h4>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <li>Voice and accountability describes how strongly 
                the public is able to influence and participate in the 
                decision making processes of government and the 
                wider society. This might entail the responsiveness 
                of politicians to public concerns through public 
                consultation, voter surveys or communication with 
                business groups, unions or cooperatives. Voice and 
                accountability in this report represents the perceptions 
                of the extent to which citizens can participate in the 
                decisions of their government.</li>
              <br>
              <li>Emphasising the interrelated nature of the pillars, 
                the level of voice and accountability can also be 
                strongly dependent on how efficiently information 
                flows between government and society.<br>
                Where information is free flowing and unbiased it 
                is more likely that civil society will be able to gain a 
                greater understanding of the actions of government, 
                how they might be impacted and voice their support 
                or opposition to the policy. In addition, better 
                information flows can help government monitor the 
                concerns of its citizens and the impact of its actions. </li>
