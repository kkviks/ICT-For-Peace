            <h3>SEAMLESS FLOW OF INFORMATION </h3>
            <div id="for-fonts">
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="justify">The free flow of information is essential to a well-informed society. Accurate and well-distributed
                information underpins the free market, improves human 
                capital, provides transparency of government decisions 
                and improves judicial and government decisions. The 
                measures for the free flow of information capture how 
                easily citizens can gain access to information, including 
                whether the media is free and independent, as well as 
                the extent to which citizens are informed and engaged 
                in the political process and the diversity of access to 
                information, such as measured through internet access 
                or simply the ability to express political views. In this 
                sense, the free flow of information is an attempt to 
                account for the degree of access to information as well 
                as the independence of that information from vested 
                political and economic interests. In this respect, freedom 
                of the press is also helpful in countering corruption as 
                greater transparency can provide a means for increasing 
                the oversight of resource distribution by the media.</p>
              <p align="justify">Freedom of information can have many flow-on effects for society as the open and unbiased 
                dissemination of information helps play a key 
                role in keeping governments accountable, driving 
                economic efficiencies and enabling civil society to 
                better participate in political processes and express 
                opinions without fear or prejudice.</p>
              <p align="justify">Media is also 
                an important driver of community perceptions, with 
                research suggesting that the way in which information 
                is presented can have a powerful impact on community 
                perceptions of reality.To assess the level to which free flow of information
                is associated with peace a range of indicators were 
                selected which assess the extent to which communities 
                could access a variety of information sources. Measures 
                included the extent of mobile phone ownership, the 
                level of civic activism and the 'Freedom of the Press' 
                index.</p>
              <p align="justify">Overall, those countries which had greater information 
                flows also tended to be more peaceful. Measures pertaining 
                to greater press freedom and communication coverage were 
                positively associated with peace. In particular, Freedom 
                House's 'Freedom of the Press' index was found to be 
                strongly associated with how peaceful a country is. The 
                measure is based on a comprehensive range of sources 
                such as reports from specialists, governments and human 
                rights organisations and provides an important benchmark 
                for measuring freedom of the press across countries. <br>
                When the relationship between a country's level of press 
                freedom and peace was examined according to income and 
                geographical groupings the relationship remained. However, 
                when the data was examined by regime type a clear pattern 
                emerged with countries classified as 'full democracy' or 
                'flawed-democracy' tending to be more peaceful and 
                enjoying greater levels of press freedom than 'authoritarian 
                regimes' and 'hybrid regimes'.</p>
              <p align="justify">This tendency for nations with freer flowing information 
                to be more peaceful also held true when analysed by the 
                reported mobile phone usage, with countries with higher 
                mobile phone ownership tending to be more peaceful. This contention is supported by research focusing 
                on households in Uganda. Specifically, it was found that 
                greater mobile phone coverage accompanied increases in 
                commodity sales in remote communities.</p>
