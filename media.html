              <p align="justify">The mass media have extended their reach
                in what is termed
                era of globalisation, marked by the end of the cold war and
                collapse of the Soviet Empire. This era of globalisation
                possesses unique features differ
                entiating it from the former era
                of
                internationalism </p>
              <p align="justify">The media have played their role in promoting conflict as well
                as enhancing peace, or protecting human rights. For example
                the CNN playe
                d a role in the withdrawal of American troops
                from
                Somalia in the 1990s by showing graphic pictures of the bodies of American solders nineteenth being dragged along the
                street. This was continuation of the Vietnam syndrome in
                which the media was seen as ‘l
                osing the war’ for the USA.
                Similarly in Rwanda hate Radio played significant role in
                increasing the killing and genocide but it is also to be no
                ted
                that the radio milles colli
                nes
                station was set up as part of peace
                and democratisation project supported by
                international
                organisations( Allen and Stremlau, 2006, p.4). The media
                can
                be for
                and against conflict sometimes
                , in Sudan my home
                country the media played a great role in the 1990s in mobilising
                public and contributing them to war and conflict by media
                specially the TV which produced
                a
                weekly programme called
                (Fee sahat Alfeda)
                in redemption arena or to scarification, this
                programme make the fighting in the south a holly and made it
                Jihad that made all people support it and involved. Whereas
                the first st
                ep after the peace agreement the government
                stopped the programme and the media produced new
                programmes which can support peace building and decrease
                the conflict’s reasons. Also the example from the case of Darfur
                can clearly show how media is powerful an
                d how it can breeds
                many
                reactions nationally or internationally
                , in 2004 after one
                year
                of the conflict breakdown
                , the
                New York Time’s columnist
                published an article about Darfur with some photos and that
                was the beginning of the save Darfur form which pl
                ayed a
                great role in internationalisation the conflict. </p>

                  <li>Can we benefit from the abilities and power of
                    the m
                    edia to enhance peace and prevent human beings from
                    falling victim to the myths of the need for war and conflict?
                    Before doing this, it is important to discuss the media’s role in
                    war and conflict situations.</li>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <h4>Conflicts and its types:</h4>
                  <br>
                  <li>There are different kinds of conflicts, these diversity come from
                    the verity of its causes and locations, so there is the internal
                    conflict which, is between two parties in same country or more,
                    as there is regional conflict that between two neighbouring
                    c
                    ountries and the international one that between more than one
                    countries like the first and second world wars. And as it is an
                    old phenomena which, featured all periods, but it become the
                    post
                    -
                    cold war remarks, as it dominates the contemporary’s
                    political c
                    oncerns. </li>
                  <br>
                  <li><strong>Political conflict</strong> : </li>
                  <br>
                  <li>Political conflict refers to war, revolution, or other struggles
                    that may force the authorities to use force, as the term of armed
                    conflict.
                    Instead
                    of searching for some proper social resolutions,
                    7
                    and can be a result of some social settings, which increase the
                    tensions among people, especially counterparts or politicians
                    from competing parties. Conflict may escalate between
                    individuals, who may be su
                    pported by their
                    tribes,
                    and
                    associations, which have power, or loud voices that may
                    influence the stakeholders.</li>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <li><strong>Ethnic/Tribal war:</strong></li>
                  <br>
                  <li> The ethnic conflict is the conflict that is between to ethnic
                    groups, as it cold the tribal conflict as it can
                    arises between two
                    or more tribes. So as a result of nation state disappearance and
                    decrease in its political and economic power the ethnic conflict
                    increase and become one of the significant signal of
                    globalisation era, causing crisis and violence again
                    st civilians,
                    as it causes regional or international interventions which, is for
                    the protection of the civilians. </li>
                  <br>
                  <li><strong>Religious conflict:</strong></li>
                  <br>
                  <li>The variety and widespread religious beliefs may sometimes
                    cause conflicts, and could form a source of potential tension.
                    This does not mean that religion is c
                    onflictive, but may spark
                    conflict, if people are different in race and ethnicity, where a
                    weak group can use it as a tool with the purpose of gaining
                    power in the political or economic fields. Also, disagreement
                    may arise in a context of religious diversi
                    ty, if people refuse to
                    accept or choose to ignore others’ faith. ‚In virtually every
                    heterogeneous society, this means religious difference in source
                    of conflict, a triggering event that can cause the conflict to
                    escalate and at this stage, tactics often
                    come detached from
                    goals and radical interpretations are increasingly favoured‛. </li>
                  <br>
                  <li>In relation to war the media can be used in dif
                    ferent and
                    opposite ways. ‚For instance, in a case of war, the media can
                    select to focus on the destruction of war as opposed to freedom
                    from tyranny, can frame the event as an invasion versus attack,
                    can emphasize the victims versus invaders, and can hig
                    hlight a
                    positive versus negative attitude toward the war.‛ </li>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <li>News media in the era of globalisation benefits from the
                    technological revaluation and add many elements to its old
                    coverage way which make it more attractive and then fu
                    ll of
                    power, from these elements I can take the photograph’s power
                    in printed media,
                    for example during the war every side tend
                    to reflect that the troops are not in danger, as it can play the
                    opposite role by reflecting the miserable face of the civilian
                    s or
                    the troop as well as the videos and TV coverage.</li>
                  <br>
                  <h4>Media and Globalisation</h4>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <li>“
                    Two words, media and globalisation: seem to be repeated
                    over and over again. The two go together like
                    a horse and
                    carriage to use a pre globalisation metaphor. (we need to
                    decide which comes first), or like computer and screen to use a
                    high globalisation metaphor.) Internationally, glob
                    alisation
                    is said to make the nation state increasingly irrelevant.
                    Therefore, globalisation can be beneficial as it is able to cross
                    borders created by external powers and without any concern or the differences or similarities in cultures between people
                    in
                    the state. Therefore, the media can play a positive role in
                    bridging the gaps and creating unity, in how it influences and
                    guides. However, the media may also play negative roles by
                    creating new values and guiding the public to adopt them,
                    resulting in
                    cultural conflicts between conservatives and
                    believers in the new concepts.</li>
                  <br>
                  <p align="justify">He media can play a p
                    ositive role in bridging the

                  <h4>Role of the Media in Building Peace: </h4>
                  <br>
                  <p align="justify">Lack of information can, at any stage
                    of a conflict, make people
                    distressed, restless and easy influenced. The ability to make
                    informed decisions strengthens societies and fosters economic
                    growth, democratic structures and the positive outlook on the
                    future. </p>
                  <br>
                  <p align="justify">The media with all its means and types can play a significant
                    role, and can influence the conflict area positively, by applying
                    its influence towards ending the conflict, or at least enhancing
                    the peace
                    environment and driving public towards peace.
                    I will
                    try to summarise some appropriate ways which can enhance
                    peace, journalists have to precise about what they know and if
                    they have not the knowledge they have dig into the history of
                    the place and the roo
                    ts of the conflict, they also have to focus
                    on the human rights and show the parties the conflicts effects
                    on the citizen. Moreover they must pick up any peace initiative
                    and
                    explore it, try to report on invisible effects for example the
                    psychological dama
                    ge and
                    trauma. </p>
                  <br>
                  <p align="justify">Broadcasting news by using community radios can help reach
                    people in different areas, even with different languages more
                    easily. This way people can be addressed directly and their
                    own personal experiences and lives can be incorporated much
                    better, than with foreign media. The danger of manipulation
                    and inflammation of ethnic tensions, however, cannot be 25
                    ignored. Another advantage of local media, especially radio is
                    that in border areas it is possible to convey peace messages to
                    passing fight
                    ers and refugees alike (Kuusik, 2010)
                    . Democratic
                    media structures need more than this; it is vital that the use of
                    informat
                    ion within a society is not solemnly passive but that
                    the population gets actively involved in creating content and
                    broadcasting it
                    . For example after the comprehensive peace
                    agreement between Sudan government and SPLM( Sudan
                    People Liberalization Movement
                    ) the UN established many
                    radio stations which
                    re
                    present its programmer in local
                    languages, and that to enhance the peace culture and minimize
                    the hate feelings bet
                    ween the two parties. Also in the North the
                    government established a radio station which is especially for
                    peace

                  <p align="justify">local media is vital, and must play a
                    significant role in helping people in different areas, using
                    all
                    local languages, especially in broadcasts (radio and TV), which
                    can reach all areas. People can address their personal
                    experiences to the local, unlike the foreign media, as they can
                    cooperate much better with it. It is also possible to convey
                    peace m
                    essages through the local radio to the fighters and
                    displaced persons, and influence them to respond positively to
                    peace efforts. However, local media can also create more
                    problems in the conflict area, and worsen the situation, through
                    manipulation and in
                    flammation of ethnic tensions.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p align="justify">The most important role of media in conflict situations lies in
                    balancing th
                    e reports, demonstrating the effects of the conflict
                    and exposing manipulations. There must be ethical guidelines
                    for reporting and selecting interviewees, who must be from
                    those affected, and must be allowed to give their opinions
                    freely. </p>
                  <br>
                  <p align="justify">It is importa
                    nt to train peace journalists, and provide them
                    with all the safety strategies and equipment, as well as ethical
                    guidelines and principles of reporting in conflict, as an
                    extraordinary situation. The conflict area must enjoy freedom
                    in speech, and access t
                    o the media, as well as freedom for the
                    journalists themselves. </p>
                  <br>
                  <p align="justify">I will conclude with the importance of media and journalists in
                    conflict management and peace building. However, to gain
                    these advantages, the media must work in a healthy and free
                    environmen
                    t, and has ethical and moral responsibilities in
                    reporting conflict, where it must work towards enhancing
                    peace. It is essential to benefit from globalisation, where this
                    global village is developing new concepts and principles for the
                    media, more than rec
                    ent ones that commercialised it. It is
                    important to concede to diversity of cultures, values, traditions
                    and hopes, in reporting outside events. </p>
