            <h3> GOOD RELATIONS WITH NEIGHBOURS </h3>
            <div id="for-fonts">
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="justify">Good relations with neighbours refer to the relationship 
                between individuals, communities and states. While this 
                Pillar is expected to be strongly linked to the acceptance of 
                the rights of others, it is different as it measures the quality 
                of relationships between the constituent groups within 
                the country and also the quality of the relations with its 
                neighbouring countries. Furthermore, the acceptance of the 
                rights of others is more closely aligned with the recognition 
                of individual rights rather than the interaction of groups. 
                Because better relationships are associated with stronger 
                bonds between community groups, it is expected that 
                countries which have better local and regional relationships 
                will be more integrated economically, less likely to engage in 
                conflict, more likely to discourage crime, and are more likely 
                to seek to maintain productive regional relationships.</p>
              <p align="justify">Good relations with neighbours have been shown to 
                be strongly associated with peace. For example, research 
                suggests that social divisions over nationalism, ethnicity, 
                and religion are associated with a higher probability of the 
                occurrence of conflict.Poor regional relations tend 
                to accompany higher than average military expenditure, 
                more armed services personnel, a greater number of heavy 
                weapons per capita, and more displaced people. In addition, 
                hostile relations virtually prohibit the possibility of regional 
                economic integration, eliminating the chance of mutual 
                gains from trade.  There is also evidence to suggest that 
                the greater level of military expenditure which is related to 
                poor regional relationships reduces economic growth.</p>
              <p align="justify">To explore the relationship between community and 
                interstate relationship and peace a range of factors were 
                analysed to proxy the quality of community relationships. 
                These included 'the extent of regional integration' and the 'hostility to 
                foreigners/private property'. Examination of the tendency for more integrated 
                states to be more peaceful was confirmed when countries 
                were separated by geographical groupings, regime types, 
                and income levels.</p>
              <p align="justify">Better relations with neighbours drive peace and greater 
                peace encourages better relation with neighbours. 
                Because better relations with neighbours is likely to 
                encourage trust, tolerance and the flow of information 
                in the community It is suggested that improvements in 
                this Pillar will tend to reinforce and be reinforced by the 
                free flow of information, the acceptance of the rights of 
                others and a sound business environment.</p>
