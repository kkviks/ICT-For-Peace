            <h3>IRRIDICATION OF CORRUPTION </h3>
            <div id="for-fonts">
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="justify">Corruption describes the abuse of a position to gain undue 
                advantage. This might occur through a range of channels, 
                such as through government, business or community 
                relationships. This might include a range of actions such as 
                government officials asking for a facilitation payment for the 
                processing of documents, police ignoring illegal activity in 
                return for payment, or political candidates directly bribing 
                voters. Although to the reader many of these activities may 
                seem to be clear examples of corruption, it is important 
                to realize that what is considered to be 'corrupt' can vary 
                significantly between different cultures, countries and 
                regions</p>
              <p align="justify"> In societies with high corruption, resources may be 
                inefficiently allocated, resulting in essential services 
                decaying quickly because of poor construction or resources 
                being badly allocated such that schools and hospitals 
                miss out on appropriate funding. Research has also found 
                links between corruption, price stability, economic growth, 
                and the level of GDP per capita which would affect the 
                functioning of the overall business environment, thereby 
                undermining peace and a sound business environment.</p>
              <p align="justify">It is found that there is detrimental association between conflict and corruption, 
                and some support for there being an association with 
                specific types of violence, such as terrorism, and corruption. 
                Importantly, the types of corruption which were found to 
                be particularly detrimental to peace were corruption in the 
                police, military and judiciary. </p>
              <p align="justify"> the extent of corruption also provides an 
                indication of the extent public resources are allocated 
                for the purposes of sectional interests, it is also likely to 
                be associated with greater financing opportunities for 
                engaging in internal conflict. That is, where alternative 
                mechanisms for resolving disputes do not exist, conflict 
                may be more attractive where it can be more easily funded 
                through corruption.</p>
              <p align="justify">Corruption may also result in the generation of wider 
                community tensions, thereby undermining peaceful 
                relations. Importantly, this can occur through a range of 
                mechanisms such as fuelling grievances in response to 
                resources being used for the benefit of a privileged minority, 
                impeding economic growth, or through too few resources 
                being invested in areas which encourage peace, such as 
                education.</p>
              <p align="justify">Corruption can be a symptom of other 
                factors such as an ineffective government or a limited level 
                of law and order. An example of this might be corruption 
                impedes information flows in country. For instance, as 
                information on the allocation of government finances 
                becomes more readily available it may be that engaging in 
                corruption becomes more difficult, as it becomes easier for 
                citizens to discover illegitimate uses of public funds. </p>
              <p align="justify"> A clear dichotomy between two types of 
                societies is seen: those which have low peace and are corrupt; and 
                those which are relatively peaceful and have little corruption. 
                It appears that those experiencing the greatest levels of 
                corruption are countries which are less democratic.
                The United States, for example, can be seen as an outlier 
                in terms of it being significantly less peaceful than other 
                countries classified as full democracies. This is chiefly due 
                to America's high incarceration rates, availability of small 
                arms, high levels of military expenditure, high homicide rate 
                and engagement in a range of external conflicts. It is in stark 
                contrast to Singapore, which despite not being classified as 
                fully democratic has achieved levels of peace rivalling many 
                democracies as a consequence of its low levels of organised 
                conflict, homicide and violent crime and its good relations 
                with neighbours. </p>
              <p align="justify">Despite these hypothesised links it is important to 
                recognise that corruption alone does not cause conflict, nor 
                is the direction of causality likely to extend just to peace, 
                rather peace itself is also likely to influence corruption. </p>
