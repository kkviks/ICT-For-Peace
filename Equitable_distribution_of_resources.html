            <h3>EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF RESOURCES </h3>
            <div id="for-fonts">
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="justify">Equity describes the extent to which individuals and groups 
                are treated fairly, regardless of their personal characteristics 
                such as their social position, race, religion or gender. How 
                equitable resources and opportunities are distributed 
                throughout a society may define how easily an individual or 
                group accesses a range of vital goods and services such as 
                land, water, education, health care and justice, all of which 
                are important contributors to human development. Because 
                what is termed to be 'equitable' will vary from country to 
                country, what is considered equitable in one country may not 
                be acceptable in another. However where the distribution of 
                resources between individuals and groups is considered poor, 
                feelings of injustice and powerlessness may emerge, thereby 
                encouraging social divisions and potentially undermining 
                peace.</p>
              <p align="justify">In order to determine to what extent inequality may have 
                resulted in different outcomes in terms of peace growth 
                analysis was conducted. To do this, countries in the GPI were 
                first split into two groups according to their relatively levels 
                of inequality, as measured by the Food and Agricultural 
                Organisation (FAO)'s Gini Index for land. Average growth rates 
                for the GPI were then calculated for each group to determine 
                the extent to which each group's average level of peacefulness 
                has changed since 2008. 
                FAO's Gini's index of concentration is a measure of 
                concentration of agricultural land areas. The index measures 
                the 'evennes' of the size of land holdings. If all holdings of land 
                were to have the same area it would equal zero, suggesting 
                total equality, whilst if all agricultural land in a country was held 
                by one person it would equal one, implying total inequality. 
                If a more uneven distribution of land did in fact result in 
                lower levels of peace we would expect this to be reflected in 
                how their levels of peacefulness have evolved over time. That 
                is, we would expect greater deteriorations in the GPI scores for 
                countries with greater levels of inequality</p>
              <p align="justify">Analysis implies that the level of inequality in a 
                nation may have some capacity to predict future levels 
                of peace. As although on average, all countries have 
                experienced a decline in their levels of peacefulness, 
                those which have experienced the lowest declines 
                tended to have greater equality in terms of land 
                distribution. In addition, because it is not possible for 
                current levels of peace to impact past levels of land 
                inequality, the analysis provides additional evidence that 
                in fact high inequality is not just correlated with peace, 
                but is likely, alongside the other pillars, a causal factor. 
                This also appears to be supported by evidence in the 
                literature, with landlessness and land inequality being 
                commonly cited as a source of tensions and potentially 
                conflict.  For instance, analysis focussed 
                on explaining conflict in Nepal during the Maoist 
                insurgency found that the intensity of conflict could be 
                explained by the extent of landlessness.</p>
