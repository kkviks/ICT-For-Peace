            <h3>PROVIDING INFORMATION </h3>
            <div id="for-fonts">
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="justify">Information can be a huge boon in peace-building operations, by strengthening the ties between individuals and communities and improving their ability to share, learn and interact with one another. Greater information also means a better ability to understand situations and act accordingly. For example: </p>
              <div align="justify">
                <ol>
                  <li type="1"><em><strong>Internet connectivity.<br>
                    </strong></em>The internet itself is a huge boon to information sharing. However, as connecting to the internet is a challenge in many places in the world, increasing information flow first means increasing connectivity. A number of tools enable users to connect to the Internet where commercial ventures can't or won't provide service. For instance, the<a target="_blank" href="http://www.inveneo.org/"> Inveneo Communications System</a> is designed to provide computing, Internet Access and VoIP telephony for areas with few resources and less then hospitable climates. The rugged communications hub can run off solar power, an electrical grid or be powered by other means such as pedal power. In the volatile northern provinces of Uganda, Inveneo connected relief organizations and greatly improved the efficiency and effectiveness of their work, while at the same time building a foundation for future use of ICTs once the conflict has ended.</li>
                  <br>
                  <li type="1"><em><strong>Mobile technology, cell phones and personal data assistants (PDAs).<br>
                    </strong></em>Personal communication devices can dramatically increase the flow of information, even in places where few other ICTs are available. For instance, in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa the<a target="_blank" href="http://www.fahamu.org/"> UmNyango Project </a>is using SMS technology to allow those with cell phones to access information and report violence against women and children, as well as violations of women's right to own land. </li>
                  <br>
                  <li type="1"> <em><strong>Geographic information systems (GIS).</em></strong> <br>
                    GIS systems - software that captures, stores, and analyzes data tied to geographic locations - can be used to help track refugee movement, maintain observation of borders (which are often not obvious from the ground), and record where atrocities have occurred. Names and borders are often in flux in turbulent areas, making electronic maps constructed using geographic coordinates much more reliable than paper maps.</li>
                  <br>
                  <li type="1"><em><strong>Satellite imagery.</em></strong><br>
                    Amnesty International is now inviting everyday citizens to monitor high resolution satellite imagery focused on 12 villages in high risk areas in Sudan, via the website <a target="_blank" href="http://www.eyesondarfur.org/">Eyes on Darfur</a>. While this is a new use of technology for Amnesty and its ultimate utility will need to be judged, one trend is clear - this type of technology will make it harder for regimes to take action in the dark.</li>
                  <br>
                  <li type="1"><em><strong>E-mail discussion lists and forums.</em></strong><br>
                    Email lists and website forums can connect communities and encourage ongoing conversations, even among citizens directly involved in a conflict and those in the diaspora. Throughout the wars in the Former Yugoslavia, lists were formed both within ethnic communities and across them to improve the quality and quantity of information emerging from the conflicts. More formal online communities such as the<a target="_blank" href="http://e-democracy.org/"> eDemocracy Issues Forum </a>support community discussions and debates, improve government transparency and engage citizens in dialogue about issues important to them.</li>
                  <br>
                  <li type="1"><em><strong>Internet Relay Chat (IRC).</em></strong><br>
                    IRC is a solid, reliable method of facilitating anonymous, recorded group discussions over the internet. With a skilled facilitator and communication guidelines, IRC can be a very effective methods to allow groups to anonymously conduct negotiations or discuss sensitive issues. This and other chat tools, such as Skype and MSN Messenger, have been used to facilitate online discussions among both small and large groups.</li>
                  <br>
                  <li type="1"><em><strong>Radio. </em></strong><br>
                    In the age of connectivity the lines between traditional media have blurred. Radio stations are now broadcasting via the Internet, and community-based stations find content to augment their local broadcasts by searching the web. In many communities, radio is the only link to the outside world. For instance, Search for Common Ground has launched <a target="_blank" href="http://www.radiopeaceafrica.org/">Radio for Peacebuilding Africa</a>, which aims to develop, spread and encourage the use of radio broadcasting techniques and content for peace-building. A joint Israeli-Palestinian radio station, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.allforpeace.org/">Radio All for Peace </a>helps to bridge the divide between Palestinian and Israeli society through stories of interest to both.</li>
