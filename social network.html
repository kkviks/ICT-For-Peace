            <div id="for-fonts">
              <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="justify">It is logical that the most innovative ideas regarding peace and security can best be spread<br>
                through the use of the internet and mass communication.</p>
              <p align="justify">Facebook, the world’s premiere social
                networking site, has over 500 million users and is also growing exponentially.</p>
              <div align="justify">
                <ol>
                  <li>Global mass
                    communication and the internet age has assisted in erasing the “imagined communities” that
                    were essential to helping nations establish their own separate histories through common
                    language.</li>
                  <br>
                  <li>The elements of globalization and liberal capitalism have partiallyundermined various tenets of traditional nationalism but this is not necessarily a negative effect of
                    globalization if it is approached in a positive manner. Conscientious citizens can establish and
                    participate in their own transnational “imagined communities” and collaborate on peace and
                    security issues that affect all of us.</li>
                  <li>Social networks have been redefined in recent years because of new technologies and
                    user interfaces on the internet. Many organizations rely on a certain hierarchy that is fixed and
                    this is referred to as a centralized network. However, social networks such as Facebook tend to							      create decentralized and distributed networks among as they connect groups of individuals<br>
                    together. There are clear benefits in terms of redundancy in decentralized and distributed
                    networks as opposed to centralized ones. A decentralized network does not rely on any one
                    single node for communication and information flow to continue throughout all the members of
                    that network.</li>
                  <br>
                  <li> Many social networks on the internet and in civil society have started to share similarities
                    with distributed networks but they are still limited in certain regards. Social networks have
                    certainly extended their reach geographically to cover a good portion of the developing world but
                    there is still a great deal of untapped potential as far as networking goes. Most of the
                    connections between people on these networks do not step very far from regional borders.
                    Increasing the direct social and professional connections between the people of different
                    countries and continents may still prove to be a daunting task. This means that there are still
                    potentially numerous people in the world who have innovative and positive solutions to creating
                    a more secure and peaceful world and they have no proper outlet for expressing their voice.</li>
                  <br>
                  <li>A perfect example of how one individual voiced his opinion to help create a safer world
                    is that of Oscar Morales. Mr. Morales is a civil engineer who hails from Colombia and like most
                    of his fellow Colombians, was unhappy with the practices of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
                    Colombia (FARC). His frustration and ire was particularly enraged on the FARC’s ill treatment
                    of a small boy who was held hostage for a number of years. He decided to create a separate
                    Facebook page denouncing FARC and their illegal activities. His Facebook group grew by the
                    day and even spread internationally outside the borders of Colombia. Eventually, the members
                    of the group that Morales created decided to stage a public march on February 4, 2008, precisely
                    one month after the group’s online foundation. The result was that millions of people marched
                    against FARC inside Colombia and millions more marched against FARC outside the borders of
                    Colombia. All it took was a simple Facebook message and an outraged citizen to spark positive
                    social action.Many of us wonder, even now, just when and where the next so
                    called ‘Facebook Revolution’ will occur.</li>
                  <br>
                  <li>There is a danger in saying that the internet and social media sparked revolution inside
                    Egypt and other countries that remain under oppressive rule. Years of oppression and
                    totalitarianism were the primary sparks that ignited protest while social media was merely the fan
                    to the flame. Revolution may have occurred inside Egypt with or without the use of social media
                    but it just may not have been as collaboratively organized or expediently efficient otherwise.
                    The American, French, and Bolshevik Revolutions all occurred because people in those
                    respective countries felt oppressed and they managed to stage uprisings despite the lack of
                    internet access. We must also remember that the final outcome of the Facebook Revolution
                    throughout the Middle East has not yet been fully decided.</li>
                  <br>
                  <li><em><strong>Wikileaks – For Better or Worse? </em></strong> </li>
                  <br>
                  <li>Many of us are familiar with the recent controversy surrounding the non-profit
                    organization known as Wikileaks. Wikileaks, which publishes classified government documents,
                    has created a certain transparency to the actions of governments. Many argue that a certain level of transparency is good governance and that Wikileaks and their supporters are merely acting
                    within the realms of good journalism. Proponents of Wikileaks argue that those who run the
                    website are no different than “respectable and responsible reporters working for top flight news
                    organizations” and that it is their journalistic duty to report on classified information. </li>
                  <br>
                  <li>Transparency in government and strong democracy are often associated with each other.
                    However, many question the ethics and procedures of the Wikileaks organization stating that the
                    publication of classified documents results in more harm than good. Certain critiques respect
                    and support the right of Wikileaks to criticize governments but they caution that publishing
                    material without properly vetting the data can lead to egregious consequences, “minimizing harm
                    does not mean not damaging the public profile of government. It means not naming informants,
                    human activists, or innocent third parties if that would prompt reprisals. It means not providing
                    detailed information that would help terrorists attack a public institution.”</li>
                  <br>
                  <li>The main purpose of Wikileaks is to
                    expose interactions between governments and make international relations more transparent.
                    Exposing governments in some cases may make the world a more safer and peaceful place and in
                    others that may make the world less safe and more violent. The creation of Wikileaks and
                    websites like it may eventually force governments to change the way they conduct business with
                    each other and with their citizens. That may be a good thing in many regards and in certain
                    situations but there is likely to be great controversy over whether Wikileaks is the proper method
                    for exacting change.</li>
